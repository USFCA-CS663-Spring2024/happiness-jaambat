# My Setup

From the terminal, create and activate the virtual environment:
```
cd happiness-jaambat
mkdir venv
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

I used PyCharm IDE for development and linked the interpreter with the following steps:
```
Pycharm -> Settings -> Project: happiness-jaambat
Python Interpretter -> Add Interpretter
Add Local Interpretter -> /happiness-jaambat/venv
```

From the terminal, install the required libraries:
```
cd happiness-jaambat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
